This code configures a 3D web app using React, Three.js, and Vite. The App component sets up a canvas, rendering the Experience component with interactive controls and a basic 3D shape. Dependencies include `@react-three/drei` and `@react-three/fiber`. The project uses Vite for development and ESLint for linting. Enhancements could include code comments for clarity and a more descriptive GitHub repository description.
